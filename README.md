## Automating Occupied Bandwidth and Out-Of-Band Emissions measurements in the context of ETSI EN 300 220-1

Automating measurement procedures in compliance testing for radio equipment isn't easy without spending a lot of money for proprietary solutions. This project aims to implement a basic automation solution in Python for two specific tests in the context of ETSI EN 300 220-1: occupied bandwidth and out-of-band emissions. EN 300 220-1 is a standard applying to short-range devices (SRD) in the frequency range of 25 MHz to 1 GHz. These two tests require testing under extreme conditions which further add to the effort needed to execute them manually. The automation solution integrates three instruments: a Spitzenberger and Spies system that acts as an AC/DC power supply for the equipment under test (EUT), a Weiss Technik Climatic Test Chamber in which the EUT is placed to simulate extreme conditions and a Rohde & Schwarz FSV Spectrum Analyzer for monitoring and measurement. The automated test process is outlined as follows:
